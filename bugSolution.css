The solution to the CSS specificity issue involves carefully considering the order of rules and the specificity of the selectors.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#id .special div {
  color: purple;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

div {
  color: blue;
}

#id div {
  color: green;
}
```

In this corrected version, the highly specific `#id .special div` rule is placed first, ensuring its style overrides any other less specific selectors.  This ensures that the `color: purple` is always applied, resolving the browser inconsistency.  This is a good practice for preventing specificity issues.
